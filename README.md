# -Inverted-index-using-Spark-
This project is about implementing an inverted index using Apache Spark for building the
index and a relational database (e.g. SQLite) for storing the index. You should use
Python (PySpark) for this project. Storing the index in a database offers the benefit of
using the B-Tree data structure offered by a relational database instead of building it from
the scratch.
